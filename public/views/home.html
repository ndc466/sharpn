              <h2>Our Vision</h2>
              <p>
                    <b>Sharpn Ministries</b> is a biblically based ministry focused on the maintenance and enhancement of sobriety through spiritual fitness. We exist as a non-profit organization providing tools and resources for intentional recovery. As a ministry, we create environments where recovering drug addicts and alcoholics can find strength and hope in their recovery through confidence in their walk with Christ. Sharpn Ministries' classes, personal mentoring, physical fitness programs, and sober living all revolve around our core value of ongoing development. Through systems of evaluation and goal focused adjustment we believe Sharpn Ministries offers a platform for change and the opportunity to transition from destruction to construction.
